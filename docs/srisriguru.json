<p>I think you are asking the wrong person!</p>

<p>There was a gentleman here from Germany and a lady from Italy. Both of them had married several times before. They came here and said, &lsquo;Gurudev, we want your blessings. At least this marriage should work.&rsquo;</p>

<p>I asked the gentleman if he knew Italian and he said no. I asked the lady if she knew German and she said no. Both of them did not know English. I said, &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t learn each others language then it will work!&rsquo;</p>

<p>There is a proverb in Kannada which says, &lsquo;It is only through words that conflicts begin. It is only through words that people have fun. It is only through words that people gain wealth. So, words should be used sparingly.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Usually, when people have some misunderstanding, they say, &lsquo;Let us talk it out.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The talk it out does not work at all. We should never talk it out. Just move on, that&rsquo;s it! Don&rsquo;t sit and discuss the past. Don&rsquo;t ask any explanation about the past. When a mistake happens, it happened, that&rsquo;s it. You should move on.</p>

<p>Just imagine yourself in a position where you do a mistake and someone keeps asking for an explanation about your mistake. It is such a burden to explain to somebody or to justify oneself, right?</p>

<p>Never make the other person feel guilty. This is very important. Anyone whom you make to feel guilty will cease to be your friend somewhere deep inside. The bond of friendship gets loosened.</p>

<p>There is a skill in making a person aware of his mistake without making him feel guilty. However, the normal tendency in human beings is to make someone feel guilty and then feel happy about it. We have to rise above this normal tendency, and not make someone feel guilty. Then, your relationship will be longstanding.</p>

<p>There is one secret for women and one for men. Maybe this will work if you think about it. For women, you should never step on the ego of your man.</p>

<p>The whole world may say to a gentleman that he has no brains, but the wife should never say that. She should always say, &lsquo;You are the most intelligent person on the planet. Just the fact that you don&rsquo;t use your brain does not mean you don&rsquo;t have it!&rsquo;</p>

<p>She should always pump his ego. This is very much essential.</p>

<p>If the lady keeps telling her partner, &lsquo;You are good for nothing. You are a vegetable&rsquo;, he will really become one!</p>

<p>Now, the secret for men &ndash; A man should never step on the emotions of a woman. She may complain to you about her brother, or mother, or family, but you should not join the bandwagon. The moment you start nodding at her complaint, she will turn around. Instead of dwelling on her complaints, she will complain about you. She will start turning the wheel around.</p>

<p>And if she wants to go for some religious program, pilgrimage, movie or shopping, just agree and give her the credit card!</p>

<p>So, if you don&rsquo;t step on the emotion of a woman, everything will be fine.</p>

<p>Now for both of you &ndash; Don&rsquo;t ask proof of the other person&rsquo;s love for you.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t ask, &rsquo;Do you really love me?&rsquo; Never give the burden to someone to prove his or her love for you. Do you see what I am saying?</p>

<p>If you find their love for you is less, you should say, &rsquo;Why do you love me so much?&rsquo; Don&rsquo;t say, &rsquo;You don&rsquo;t love me&rsquo;, and things like that. </p>"

<p>He said, &ldquo;Then how will I spend my evenings? All my longing will be gone. Then she becomes a nag in my head. She keeps nagging me all the time, pain in the neck. I would never make that mistake.&rdquo;</p>

<p>However beautiful a woman one has married, a partner, however beautiful they are, their eyes go elsewhere, what is not with them, because the longing has disappeared. When longing disappears, love disappears. </p>

<p>When you&rsquo;re husband, wife and you spend all twenty-four hours together, morning till night, you get tired of the person. It&rsquo;s quite but natural. Love dies very soon, within six months, one year. Then, just out of courtesy, each one says, &ldquo;Oh, I love you very much.&rdquo; There is no garden happening inside. </p>

<p>A fountain is not arising. But outside, just not to hurt the other person, says, &ldquo;Oh, you are beautiful. I love you very much, dear.&rdquo; One doesn&rsquo;t want to look into that. One doesn&rsquo;t want to say it, because there is no longing. It has all disappeared.</p>

<p>In ancient Vedic times, there was a tradition. One month during the rainy season, the wives would be sent to their parent&rsquo;s home. So in that one month, every husband would write letters. </p>

<p>Poetry came out of the husbands and wives. That gap, that gap creates love. Longing creates love. Longing, that pain of separation, increases the love in you. That increases the prayerfulness in you.</p>"

<p>Gurudev:</p>

<p>See, when you love a person with an intention to gain something from him or her, and then such kind of love is definitely going to get finished. But instead if there is a deep feeling to give and to do something for the other one, then such a love will never come to an end. If all you think about is &lsquo;What will I get from this person?&rsquo;, then you are always in a race or struggle to get something from them in the name of love. Such a love will surely come to an end someday or the other.</p>

<p>But if you are the one who gives, and thinks about how to give comfort to other one, then such a love endures over time. If you think, &lsquo;How can I keep my husband or wife happy?&rsquo; then that love can stay. Also, this thought should come from both the partners. Only then will the love never end between the two. Both of them should have the same goal in life. When the two lines go in opposite directions to each other, they will cross (meaning that there will be conflict or struggle to maintain love). But when they move together and stay focused on each other, and move towards a common goal, then the love will go on forever.</p>"

<p>Love is always about giving. Know that you have come here (on the planet) to only give love and not demand love from anybody.</p>


<p><strong>Demand and blame destroy relationships.</strong></p>

<p>Just imagine yourself in their situation. How would you feel if someone doubts your love for them, and you have to make an extra effort to make them believe that you love them? Is it not a burden?</p>

<p>Learn to praise your partner and uplift a situation instead of blaming and finding fault. Uplifting your partner should be your commitment . Then you are the right person for anybody, and everybody will love you when you don't hurt them intentionally.</p>

<p><strong>Be open to correction and changes, and have the patience to listen to criticism.</strong></p>

<p>You have to be patient to take in criticism.</p>
<p><strong>See your partner beyond his or her words and actions.</strong></p>

<p>When someone comes home after a long tiring day at work, it is normal for them to feel exhausted and frustrated. 
So you should understand their situation and give them the space/freedom to express their genuine feelings of frustrations, anger etc. When someone is in labor pain,
and if you say, &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t deliver, keep it, keep it, keep the baby inside.&rsquo; What can they do? How long can they keep it inside? Somewhere they have to explode. 
You should allow them to express and let go of all their stresses that they have carried all the day.</p>
<p><strong> Understand why your partner is upset or unhappy then your relationship will work.</strong></p>

<p>If you are understanding, you will allow them to tell you everything that happened and you can uplift them! But if you expect them not to tell anything and be nice to you 24/7 and find fault with them all the time, then relationships do not work!</p>"

So for half an hour he acted like his uncle and suddenly he came and said, &ldquo;You know Gurudev, I feel different now&rdquo;. So, put yourself in the shoe of the person whom you hate.</p>

<p>Secondly, why do you hate the person? Is it for what they are doing? If they are doing horrible things, either they are ignorant or they are stressed. </p>

<p>By hating them, can you change them? People make mistakes and you hate them? Why do you hate them, because they make some mistakes? </p>

<p>By hating a person who makes mistakes, can you correct them? No, you cannot correct them when you hate them. Do you want them to be corrected? Yes. So what is the way? Not hating them but by educating them. This is necessary.</p>

<p>People like ISIS, they hate everybody and people hate them. By hating we cannot change them and they cannot change us. They also do not know this. </p>

<p>Their idea is to change everybody. We hate them because they are doing such heinous crimes. But by hating will they change? No. Not hating them but educating them.</p>

<p>The young children need to be educated before they get into this kind of mind set. That&rsquo;s why, harmony in diversity should be part of the education.</p>

<p>We need to educate the mind because all crime begins here in the upper chamber. To educate somebody you need to have compassion.</p>

<p>See, in your life, you come across many people who think differently, and you want them to change, and by you wanting them to change they do not change.</p>

<p>  When you say what you are doing is hurting me, so please do not hurt me, they do not change so easily. But when you tell them what you do hurts you, so you should change, that will be much more effective. </p>

<p>This world cannot be so perfect, so broaden your vision. You cannot make everyone the way you want them to be. Unpleasant things are bound to happen. When it happens, you should have the strength and courage to move on. </p>

<p>Meditation will definitely provide you that needed strength to overcome anger. Once in a while if anger comes up, don&rsquo;t start blaming yourself. One thing that can be very detrimental on the spiritual path is self blame. </p>

<p>Keep moving ahead. This is where Sangha, group or company can also help. Whatever you cannot do alone, you can get help and support from a group, from good company. Sangha has many benefits, but a few drawbacks also. </p>

<p>It can also take up a lot of your energy. It can be draining at times. Many times you will have to compromise on something. The positive effect is that Sangha helps you to move forward. It gives you that much needed support to move forward. </p>

<p>Whenever your mind goes topsy-turvy, or if your emotions are going up and down, when your inner faith is shaken, then at such times the Sangha will carry you forward. It will help you move through the situations. </p>

<p>One negative effect of the Sangha is that if someone in the group is negative and miserable and you are not careful enough and join hands with that person, then it can bring you down as well.</p>"

<p><strong>Avidya </strong>-Ignorance is the root cause of suffering. And what is ignorance? Thinking that which is not permanent, is permanent. To think or understand that which is not changing as changing, that which is changing as not changing. That which is not joy as joy, that which is not Self as Self. I am not the body, but I think I am the body. I am not my thoughts or emotion, but I think I am my thoughts, my emotions. Ignorance is holding on to those things of the past, this and that; having an idea of who you are. People think it&rsquo;s very complimentary to know who you are, to have an idea about who you are.</p>

<p><strong> Asmita </strong>is oneness of our intellect and our Self. Have you noticed in meetings, people say a point and stick to that point? They are actually stuck with that point. Most of the people go on arguing meaninglessly, senselessly. These senseless arguments come because they are so stuck thinking that is their intellect. Intellect as themselves. Thoughts as themselves, &ldquo;my thought, my position, my, me, me&rdquo;. Inability to see the Self and the buddhi (or the intellect) and the power of the instruments of perception as separate, is asmita.</p>

<p><strong>Raga(craving)</strong> &ndash; Craving comes with a pleasant experience. You have a pleasant experience and that creates a craving in you. This craving makes you miserable. We try to control others&rsquo; mind, saying, &ldquo;You should be this way, should be that way.&rdquo; How is it possible? Someone may have loved you yesterday, but they need not today or tomorrow. Who knows? They themselves do not know.</p>

<p>You are not behaving in an enlightened way, but you expect everyone around you to be enlightened, to have unconditional love. You will get one in a million, who can be unconditional love. When you expect that from all the people around you, you become unhappy. Knowingly, unknowingly, consciously, unconsciously, this is what everybody is doing. Everybody is expecting unconditional love from people they meet, and they don&rsquo;t even know what they&rsquo;re expecting! But their expectation is something very big, they are seeking God in everybody. And they are seeking God without seeing that God could behave in any manner He wants! They are looking for a saintly God in everybody around them. How things should be make you more miserable. Do you see what I&rsquo;m saying?</p>

<p><strong>Hatred and aversion</strong> comes with an unpleasant experience. Aversion brings the same misery as happiness brings. Craving and aversion are both sources of misery.</p>

<p><strong>Abhinivesha(fear)</strong>, an unknown fear. Though intellectually you know everything, even in great scholars a little amount of abhinivesha [fear] exists. It has been seen as such. Nature has imposed all five things in everybody. How thin this can get or how thick it will remain, makes you either evolved or un-evolved.</p>

            "status": "<p>1)<strong> Friendliness: </strong>Be friendly with people who are happy. If you are not friendly with happy people, you will be jealous. This is because you think that your enemy is happy, and you cannot tolerate your enemy being happy. So, shake hands with happy people. Such an attitude does a lot of good to your mind.</p>

<p>2) <strong>Compassion: </strong>Do not be friendly with people who are miserable, instead, have compassion for them. If you are friendly with unhappy people you will become unhappy. And if you become unhappy, you can never help them to come out of their misery. </p>

<p>Many people have gotten into trouble by being friendly with unhappy people; both become miserable. It is like a doctor going to a patient who is sick, and the doctor also becomes sick. If the doctor also thinks, &lsquo;How can I alone be healthy? Let me also share the patient&rsquo;s misery&rsquo;, then who will help the patient then?</p>

<p>So, what should be the attitude with people who are miserable? Compassion, not pity.</p>

<p>3) <strong>Happiness:</strong> For people who are doing good work or who are successful in the world, you should feel happy as though you are doing it.</p>

<p>For example, someone is a good singer, singing and bringing joy to everybody, seeing him you should think, &lsquo;I feel so happy that this person is singing so well, and making everyone happy.&rsquo;</p>

<p>If someone is a good entertainer and he entertains everybody you should feel happy about it. If someone is a great architect and builds beautiful buildings you should feel happy about it. Whenever someone does a good job, share that happiness with them; we need to have this attitude.</p>

<p>4) <strong>Indifference:</strong> For people who are doing horrible things in the society, destroying themselves, we usually get angry at them. When you are angry, your mind suffers a huge loss. You lose so much energy, you lose your mood, and your enthusiasm. When energy and enthusiasm goes away from you, you become angry and are no better than the other person. You do not know what you are doing. So, what should you do in such a situation? Have a sort of indifference in your mind.</p>

<p>For example, there are thieves in the world, they are there, what can you do about them? First accept, be indifferent. However, this does not mean you do not take any action. Your mind is indifferent (unaffected), but you act on it.</p>

<p>These are the four attitudes that will help us to save our mind. This is what we need to do, save our mind at all costs.</p>"
