            "status": "<p>Yes, it is only one energy in the body, but it manifests in different forms, in different chakras. Sexual energy, love energy, intellectual energy, sharpness, awareness, anger; all these are related. You would have heard about the seven chakras (energy centers) ; it is One Energy that manifests itself in various forms. In the first chakra (Muladhara), at the base of the spine, the energy manifests as enthusiasm or inertia. When the same life force energy comes to the second chakra (Swadhisthana), it manifests as sexual energy or creative or procreative energy.</p>

<p>The same energy goes up to the navel region, the third chakra (Manipura), and manifests in four different forms, which relate to four different emotions - greed, jealousy, generosity and joy. That is why all these four emotions are depicted through the tummy.Jealousy is an emotion that one feels in the stomach. Generosity is depicted with a large tummy, e.g., Santa Claus.</p>

<p>Joy is also depicted with a big tummy, e.g., Lord Ganesha and the Laughing Buddha. The same emotion comes to the fourth chakra (Anahata), the heart chakra; manifests as three different emotions which are love, hatred and fear. When this energy rises to the fifth chakra (Vishuddha), at the level of the throat, it symbolizes grief and gratefulness.</p>

<p>When you feel grief, the throat chokes, and when you feel grateful also, the throat chokes. The same energy then goes in between the eyebrows to the sixth chakra (Ajna), and manifests as anger and alertness. Anger, alertness, knowledge, and wisdom are all related to the third eye centre. The same energy goes to the seventh chakra (Sahasrara), at the top of the head and manifests as sheer bliss.</p>

<p>That is why in any sanctuary experiences, when you feel total bliss, the mind immediately goes to the top of the head. Something shoots up to the top of the head and you feel blissful. So, the upward movement and downward movements of energy are all the emotions in life.</p> "

            <p>1.Wherever there are people, politics is bound to be there. Don&rsquo;t shy away from it and don&rsquo;t worry about it &ndash; you be rock solid. What appears to be politics will find its own way out. Have faith that only the best will happen to you and you will be able to do only the best! Keep these aphorisms with you like a treasure.</p>

<p>2.When you resist politics, then you get deeper into politics. Your perception becomes political and you will get paranoid about it. All those who are paranoid about politics get deeper into it. You should not mind it and then it will never bother you.</p>

<p><strong>What is politics?</strong><br />
Different people have different mindsets, and they air their opinions. For a while, these opinions remain and then it all changes. Some people praise you and the same people will make nasty remarks about you &ndash; all this is very common. You should take this for granted or you will become uptight. And when you are uptight, you are not aware of how you behave.<br />
It is better to keep oneself on a higher pedestal &ndash; smiling, laughing, accommodating, and accepting that there is politics. Let politics be there, so what? You have to create this confidence that you will move through it.<br />
<strong>How to rise above politics?</strong><br />
Our trouble is that we expect everyone to be Mr. or Ms. Perfect! We expect everyone&rsquo;s behavior and dealings to be perfect. We expect everyone to be saints, but they are not. This expectation is the trouble. And when anybody does anything different, we say, 'Oh, there is politics!' People&rsquo;s actions are nothing but politics &ndash; it doesn&rsquo;t have to be dirty all the time, though sometimes it is. So let it be! It takes quite a bit to rise above all this and keep your mind on the infinite, and that is enlightenment! You rise above it all.<br />
Water is never scared of mud. So, if something is muddy, assume you are water &ndash; and you can wash it all off! Just remember this, politics is mud and I am water, I will run over it.<br />
There is a beautiful poem in Kannada, 'If someone builds a home in the forest and is afraid of animals, what can I tell them? If someone has built a home on the sea shore and is scared of the waves, what can I tell them? And if someone has built a home in the middle of a market place and is complaining about the noise, what can I tell them?'<br />
Similarly, when you live on this planet, people will give you compliments and people will give you derogatory remarks &ndash; they will create politics. How can you be afraid of politics when you are on this planet? Never complain about people playing politics &ndash; that is what they have been doing and will continue to do.<br />
Lord Krishna never complained to anyone about the politics played by the families. He didn&rsquo;t say, 'Don&rsquo;t play politics, I will not come to you.' No! He was right there! Even during the time of Jesus and Buddha, there was politics.</p>

<p>When egos are there, they do clash. There is no way out. When there is wisdom, you will rise above any small-minded attitude, bickering and judgements.</p>

<p>You judge people all the time, and if you turn back and look at your own judgements, I tell you, 80 to 90% of the time, they will be wrong. Sometimes people send some messages and before the other person gets it, they retract it. How many of you have done that? You type a message to send to someone, and something tells you that this is not okay and so you retract it. How many of you do this? This shows how poor your judgements are.</p>

<p>We create a huge cloud around what is not even close to truth, and it has happened to you so many times in the past. You hold grudges against people, you have concepts about people and you get yourself trapped into it. You must wake up from this. You know, if your time is good, your worst enemy behaves like a friend, and if your times are bad, your closest friend behaves like an enemy. So, your luck or time is totally responsible for your friends and enemies. Your karma is responsible for what you go through. So, you should take your mind away from judging others and bring it to yourself. </p>

<p>Often people who complain that others have a big ego, have a big ego themselves. Often those who complain others are rude, you will see somewhere inside, they are rude. You should reflect on yourself. See, you can&rsquo;t correct others but others give you a chance to correct yourself.<br />

<p>The pain is good will make you very creative. It will bring out the poet from within you, or it will make you an artist. It can also bring out the sevak in you. It can bring out the warrior in you. You have so many good qualities, and longing will bring them all out.</p>

<p>There was one generation of Masters who were very tough. Tough in the sense, if you desire something, that will not happen. They would nip desire in the bud.<br />
If the you would say. &ldquo;I want to go to California&rdquo;, then forget about it, you will never go to California. To come to a state of no-mind, they would use this tactic of crushing every desire that would arise. At some point of time you would have to give-up, and then you go to the no-mind state when you are unconditionally happy.<br />
If you would go to them and say, &ldquo;Oh, I have this problem&rdquo;, they would say, &rdquo;It&rsquo;s your karma, bear it. You must have done something terrible, so experience it and finish it off&rdquo;. That was the attitude &ndash; no compassion. Just imagine if there is no compassion, then what do you need to do? You have to stand up.</p>

<p>A creeper needs a tree to stand up, but a tree doesn&rsquo;t need another tree to stand up. So, they would completely destroy all that is delicate in you. If you are emotional, they would take a hammer. If you complain, they would say, &lsquo;Let it be&rsquo;. If you say, &ldquo;Some people are blaming me&rdquo;. They would say, &ldquo;Yes, more people should blame you&rdquo;. They would push all your buttons and make you so numb to everything in the world, till you realize that everything is nothing. It was a very tough journey. I don&rsquo;t think anyone of you can survive for even one day, it was such a tough atmosphere.<br />
All that you identify yourself as would be simply ripped off. It was a long and tough journey. which very few could survive. And there would be a millions chances to doubt and run away, only the very strong could survive such conditions.</p>

<p>In The Art of Living, we have taken a complete 180 degree turn and adopted a completely different route. Here we say, &ldquo;What is your desire? Okay, let it be fulfilled&rdquo;. Sometimes I wonder, &ldquo;Am I making everyone weak?&rdquo; But there is no option. At least this has put you on the path of knowledge.</p>

<p>I see you all are growing. Everyone is growing but I tell you, don&rsquo;t get stuck in small little things. This world is Maya. There are always some issues that will prop up in life. You will have some excuse or some incidences to worry about. When such things come, you have to remember that this is all Maya, this is all ephemeral, this is all impermanent and stand up.</p>

<p>Your wants and desires are getting fulfilled. For some people it takes longer time, for some people it happens in a shorter time, and for some people it happens immediately. Many times, we only have put thought-constraints in our own mind. We put the sankalpa and we put the vikalpa as well. And to come out of this mess I don&rsquo;t see any other path which is as effective as ours right now. If I find something better, I will myself ask you to do it. But the other generations of masters were very different.<br />

<p>The news of so many incidences of violence happening again and again should not make us numb. This is important. We tend to become numb toward these violent incidents that happen around us. We should be cautious; we should keep our sensitivity.<br />
Keeping the sensitivity does not mean you get swayed away by it. When you feel you&rsquo;re getting carried away, affected very heavily, remember there is a power much bigger than you and everyone else, that is in charge. There is a great power in the universe, that has maintained this universe from billions of years. Have faith in that power. It will take care. Not by your doing something, is anything going to happen. The faith in a greater power in control can relieve you of your anxiety.</p>

<p>Now, that does not mean you become inactive and do nothing about it, saying, &ldquo;Oh everything is done by a greater power, why should I do anything at all?&rdquo;<br />
That type of irresponsibility is also no good. We need to take a middle path. Not saying, &ldquo;Everything is being taken care of, I don&rsquo;t need to do anything,&rdquo; or getting anxious about how things are happening, of which you are not in control.<br />
Your anxiety is because you&rsquo;re not in control. If you&rsquo;re in control, you won&rsquo;t be anxious. And you can&rsquo;t control everything. That&rsquo;s why you must remember there&rsquo;s a higher power that is taking care of things.<br />

<p>The whole idea of finding satisfaction by doing something itself is not correct. Satisfaction comes from deep rest, by reposing deep within oneself. When you get established within your Self, then there is contentment. The satisfaction you think that comes by doing some work is very temporary and lasts only for a short while.<br />
If your work is successful, then you feel the need to do more work. When you get more success, then that again drives you to work more. You do not feel like stopping after having success. On the other hand, if you face some loss or failure in what you are doing, then also you feel, &ldquo;Oh, how did it fail despite my efforts? I won&rsquo;t give up; I will try again and succeed&rdquo;. You feel challenged to do more. So you want to work more and work harder whether you get success or failure. And in this process the search for contentment continues. You keep searching for contentment when you are constantly engaged in work, or in action. It is only in knowledge that you can find your true contentment. Fulfilment or contentment lies only in wisdom, and in deep meditation; not in any work or action as such.<br />

<p>I want to tell you one story. This is the story from the life of Lord Buddha. It also includes forgiveness.</p>

<p>One day Buddha was giving a sermon and conducting a meditation. One gentlemen came from the back to the hall. He was very angry because his son did not join the business and instead joined Lord Buddha and wanted to meditate and propagate peace. So angry gentleman came in front of Buddha and spat on the face of Buddha. There were 10,000 people sitting in the hall, but then Buddha did not react and was just smiling. This man then went away. Just being in Lord Buddha&rsquo;s presence brought a shift in this gentleman because he has always encountered anger with only anger. Here is a person who did not react and was smiling instead. And that one smile of Buddha did something to him. He could not sleep the whole night. His whole life transformed. He came next day and fell at the feet of Buddha and asked for his pardon. Buddha with the same smile lifted him up and said, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t forgive you&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Everybody else was shocked. This man is sobbing, crying, asking for pardon and Buddha is saying I cannot forgive you. Then Buddha tells him, &ldquo;That man who was angry is gone and whom you spat is also not here now. They say, you cannot put your feet twice in the same river. Like that, the consciousness is also changing. The person who was there yesterday is no longer here now. So, if at all I met that person who spat and to whom you spat, I will tell him to forgive you&rdquo;.</p>

<p>See life from a broad perspective. A mistake happens through you when you are not conscious, when you are in ignorance. So, you are not responsible, it is the ignorance that was responsible.</p>"

At those moments all your spiritual practices, concepts, ideas and ideals fall apart. Your devotion, your love and all the beautiful things you cherish in your life, simply don&rsquo;t seem to be there or mean anything. You are under the influence of a big storm. A whirlwind rises in you and throws you off balance.</p>

<p><strong>What do you do? Nothing is helpful. </strong>You sit, close your eyes and try to meditate. But the mind is all over the place. You feel as though you are in a burning furnace, and you don&rsquo;t know how to put the fire out. And the more effort you make to cool it down, and put it out, the more the fire burns, the more the restlessness and agitation increase. You are yourself only between the storms. How many storms rise in your life, and how frequently do they rise? The less frequent they are, the more you are yourself. At those moments you are happy; you are settled. You are calm. Just think of those moments of intense restlessness, agitation and feverishness. The breath becomes heavier. The body becomes unbearable. You are not at all aware of the mind. But that is not what you are. You get a glimpse of the clearness of yourself between two storms. But life seems to be like the ocean &ndash; wave after wave lashing you one after another.</p>

<p><strong>This is the only problem. This is the only basic problem in the universe. </strong>There is no other problem. You can attach it to one thousand causes or reasons, but the problem is how to free your life from this storm which has gripped it.</p>

<p><strong>The first thing to do is to become aware of this. At that moment, the storm will subside.</strong> First, stop regretting things. For no reason, there is turmoil in the mind. When your mind cools down and you experience that inner cool, soft and delicate aspect of yourself, there is a big relief.</p>

<p><strong>No one storm can be there all the time. It is impossible. It comes and subsides.</strong></p>

<p>Your mind is like a wind &ndash; a whirlwind, subsiding and cooling down. That is your true nature. That is love. You have been resisting restlessness all this time. Now If you see it is there. Okay, so let it be there. It is a part of nature.&rsquo; The storm is also part of nature. <strong>Stop resisting the storm. Take it, gulp it in its totality; go deep into it and you will see it is nothing. </strong>It is just created out of yourself, your mind and your consciousness. In that aspect of you, you are your Self.</p>

<p>Know that there is a power, some power; someone who is really caring for you.</p>


<p><strong>Not just someone there is only One in the whole universe. That One in the universe is caring and taking care of you. You can relax, rest and be peaceful.</strong></p>

<p>There cannot be an ocean without waves. Every event touches life somewhere on its surface. It creates movement. Take all that comes with both your hands. Don&rsquo;t say that it is impossible or not possible for you. This thought of something being not possible means that you are resisting. This is making the storms stay for long periods. Stand there with your arms open. Say, &lsquo;Whatever storms come, let them, I&rsquo;m here.&rsquo; You grow out of them. You become bigger.</p>

<p>Tell yourself </p>

<p> <strong>&ldquo;Come what may, there is nothing that can destroy me. It may be excruciatingly painful, but it doesn&rsquo;t matter. It still cannot destroy or kill me. I am here. I am much, much bigger than all these emotions, commotions or waves. They all rise inside me, in me, and in no way can they destroy me. I will let them be.&rdquo;</strong></p>

<p>So when a storm arises, just be with it. Do not try to get rid of the storm. Be with it; go into it. And, of course, you have your meditation and spiritualÂ practices to help purify your whole system. ItÂ’s such a blessing.</p>"

<p>Why you don&rsquo;t like suffering is because in suffering you feel, &ldquo;Oh! This is death.&rsquo; You associate death with suffering. That is why there is fear. Just simple pain doesn&rsquo;t give you suffering. You willingly undergo many pains.</p>

<p>By understanding this, layer by layer, going scientifically you can observe that you pay more attention to your mind than to the senses, to your intellect more than the mind and to the ego more than your mind.</p>

<p>For example someone saying some words to somebody else doesn&rsquo;t bother you. But if they said that to you then you get upset. If you go beyond that and see, it is just their opinion. If someone passes a derogatory remark on you, how do you see it beyond the ego? With compassion, &ldquo;Ok, they are saying something because they are upset.&rdquo; Then you don&rsquo;t get hurt. When someone calls the person next to you stupid, you see it as a witness but when he does the same to you, there is a difference. Do you see the difference? If you can see that also from the same angle, as though they are fighting with somebody else, then you see it beyond ego. Then you say, &ldquo;He must be tired, stressed out&rdquo; , instead of taking it as a personal attack on you, you will see the state of mind, intention or consciousness behind the action.</p>

At least two of them said, &quot;If we had had this knowledge before, we would not have been here. Gurudev, you are responsible for us being here. Why didn&rsquo;t you teach this knowledge earlier?&quot;<br />
I agreed with them. We should have taught this in schools and colleges. To prevent crime, we have to do this. So, in that sense, we are responsible, everyone is responsible!<br />

<p>Just play with the kids, and be ready to lose the game with the kids. That is a very good exercise. Do you want to win all the time when you play with kids? You are playing a game with children, being older, do you always want to win? Your joy lies in making them win. So, you fail but you are still enjoying the game.<br />
In the same way, some failures come in life, so what? Never mind because there is something deep within you that can never fail.<br />

Recently in India, we had 155 countries come together and we celebrated The World Cultural Festival. I would like to present you a Video CD of this as well. The youth here may want to see it, or you may want to show them.<br />
This is a World Cultural Festival in which 36,600 artists from 155 countries. It was almost like Cultural Olympics. So many people gathered on a 70-acre stage where they all performed different dance and music which was watched by 1.3 billion people in 767 locations. So, it was a big stage in which all kinds of artists with flutes, guitars, sitars, drums, tablas playing music from around the world.</p>

<p>Sports and music do go together and they unite people beyond language, religion, culture and nationality. I'm so glad that you agree that this is what we need today. We are a global family and our motto is a &lsquo;One World Family&rsquo;. So this is what I would like to present to your club.</p>

<p>Women have a very important role to play. If one girl is empowered, you are empowering the whole family. Women empowerment is also one of the agendas of our Art of Living Foundation. We've been doing girl child education and prevention of female feticide in many of the Asian countries. When people find out that the fetus is a girl, many of them go for abortion. So we are making a big campaign with UNESCO and other organizations to prevent feticide. This is one of the greatest agendas we have taken up many of villages. Women empowerment is very vital otherwise you will see half of our population live in darkness. If they are unhappy society cannot be happy. The aim of sports, culture, music, business and even politics is to create a happy society.</p>

<p>If sports are played like wars, then it is no longer a sport. In one of the sports club I spoke to a boy who was disappointed because he didn't get the prize.<br />
I asked him, &quot;Why are you sad&quot;? He said, &quot;I lost in the running race&rdquo;. Then I asked him who had won the prize and he pointed out to another boy.<br />
I asked him &ldquo;Is he your friend?&rdquo; to which he said, &ldquo;Yes, he's my friend, he got the prize&rdquo;. I asked him a question, &ldquo;Suppose you had won and your friend was unhappy because you won, would you be happy about it. How would you take it?&rdquo;<br />
Suddenly the boy said, &ldquo;No! I never thought about it like that&rdquo;.<br />
I said, &ldquo;In sports it's not winning or losing, either you win or you make others win, in either case you should be happy&rdquo;. A team spirit is needed.<br />
We need to bring ethics in sports in the world. Sports without ethics will become war, sports without a friendly atmosphere of a win-win situation will only give more heart burns, more disappointment and depression. I've seen many young people who are in sports getting into depression. We need to re-orient them, tell them to do some breathing exercises, meditation and be happy. Happiness needs to be created whether you win or lose. That is what is sports.</p>

<p>The ancient cultures have said &lsquo;Life is a sport, take life sportingly. Don't take it too seriously&rsquo;. With these words, I thank you all for having me here and I wish you all good. Remember you belong to the whole world. Make the nation that you live in proud and at the same time nurture your own language, music, culture and religion. Norway is such a wonderful place which has given you this opportunity to progress in diversity.</p>"
