            "status": "<p>Yes, it is only one energy in the body, but it manifests in different forms, in different chakras. Sexual energy, love energy, intellectual energy, sharpness, awareness, anger; all these are related. You would have heard about the seven chakras (energy centers) ; it is One Energy that manifests itself in various forms. In the first chakra (Muladhara), at the base of the spine, the energy manifests as enthusiasm or inertia. When the same life force energy comes to the second chakra (Swadhisthana), it manifests as sexual energy or creative or procreative energy.</p>

<p>The same energy goes up to the navel region, the third chakra (Manipura), and manifests in four different forms, which relate to four different emotions - greed, jealousy, generosity and joy. That is why all these four emotions are depicted through the tummy.Jealousy is an emotion that one feels in the stomach. Generosity is depicted with a large tummy, e.g., Santa Claus.</p>

<p>Joy is also depicted with a big tummy, e.g., Lord Ganesha and the Laughing Buddha. The same emotion comes to the fourth chakra (Anahata), the heart chakra; manifests as three different emotions which are love, hatred and fear. When this energy rises to the fifth chakra (Vishuddha), at the level of the throat, it symbolizes grief and gratefulness.</p>

<p>When you feel grief, the throat chokes, and when you feel grateful also, the throat chokes. The same energy then goes in between the eyebrows to the sixth chakra (Ajna), and manifests as anger and alertness. Anger, alertness, knowledge, and wisdom are all related to the third eye centre. The same energy goes to the seventh chakra (Sahasrara), at the top of the head and manifests as sheer bliss.</p>

<p>That is why in any sanctuary experiences, when you feel total bliss, the mind immediately goes to the top of the head. Something shoots up to the top of the head and you feel blissful. So, the upward movement and downward movements of energy are all the emotions in life.</p> "

 A repetition without interest or love causes a monotonous state of mind; that is boredom. It overshadows the Self.</p>

<p> <strong>A practice or abhyasa </strong>is again a repetition whose purpose is to destroy the boredom and reunite with the Self. In this process the practice itself creates boredom and as you continue, it penetrates the boredom and destroys it once and for all. Whether the practice gives you joy or boredom, it must be continued. Only the practice or abhyasa can annihilate the Mind.</p>

<p> <strong>Self is Love and Love is always repetitive.</strong> That is why love letters are simply repetitive and there is no boredom there. If you are bored with yourself then how much more boring you would be for others. Root out the boredom in you through deep and continued meditation.</p>

This simply means to <b>realize that you are loved</b>, that's all.</p>
<p>Love is not an act, it is what you are; your state of being. When you are calm, serene and subtle, that's what it is. Usually here in the west, if one is angry at oneself then it is understood as �I don't love myself�. If you are angry at others that means you don't love others, no. <b>Love is there, you should never question it</b>.</p>
<p>Love gets distorted when there is no knowledge. With knowledge, it remains pure. When love gets distorted it becomes anger. You love perfection and so you get angry. You want things your way and so you get anger. When you love objects, that is greed. When you love yourself too much that is possessiveness! This is all love coming forth as emotion. So, <b>if you love yourself just relax in peace, don't be hard on yourself</b>.</p>
<h4>There are two occasions on which people are hard on oneself:</h4>
<p>1. When they pity themselves.</p>
<p>2. When one feels, �Oh, I'm so righteous, I'm too good, I did so much and see nobody recognizes me, nobody loves me�.<br>Thinking about your goodness you can become hard on yourself, and thinking about your bad qualities you become hard on yourself. In either case, you go off balance. <i>When you think good about yourself you will definitely find bad qualities in others.</i> You will search and find the wrong in others, otherwise you can never feel too good about yourself. Also, when you think others are so good and I'm not that good, I have these negative qualities then you become hard on yourself. In either case, you have fallen, you are not on your bicycle, you are not balancing.</p>
<p>Usually we think that people who are hard on themselves are those who criticize themselves. When you praise yourself also you are hard on yourself! Do you see what I'm saying? When you stick to your good qualities you are hard on yourself, and when you stick to your negative qualities you are hard on yourself.</p>"

<p>Lust bring tension Love brings relaxation<br />
Lust focuses on the part Love focuses on the whole<br />
Lust brings violence Love brings sacrifice<br />
In lust you want to grab and possess In love you want to give and surrender<br />
Lust says all I want you to have is what I want Love says I want you to have what you want<br />
In lust there is effort Love is effortless<br />
Lust causes feverishness and frustration Love causes longing and pain<br />
Lust imprisons and destroys Love liberates and sets you free<br />
Lust demands Love commands<br />
Lust gets you mixed up and confused In love you are focused and spaced out!!<br />
Lust is only dark and monotonous Love has many modes and colours</p>
</tr></tbody></table><p>If someone's lust is interrupted they get angry and start hating. Hatred in the world today is not out of love, it is out of lust.</p>
<p>Love is playfulness and in lust there is cunningness and manipulation. Shiva, the embodiment of innocence and love was meditating. His meditation was disturbed by an arrow of flowers from the lord of lust. As soon as Shiva woke up he opened his third eye and the lord of lust, Manmatha (one who churns the mind) was reduced to ashes. Everybody celebrated by throwing colors on each other realising that life is full of colours.</p>
<p>We play many roles in our life. If all the roles get mixed up it becomes dark, like when you mix all the colours. The wise play each role distinctively side by side, like colors displayed side by side form a rainbow.</p>"

<p>I think you are asking the wrong person!</p>

<p>There was a gentleman here from Germany and a lady from Italy. Both of them had married several times before. They came here and said, &lsquo;Gurudev, we want your blessings. At least this marriage should work.&rsquo;</p>

<p>I asked the gentleman if he knew Italian and he said no. I asked the lady if she knew German and she said no. Both of them did not know English. I said, &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t learn each others language then it will work!&rsquo;</p>

<p>There is a proverb in Kannada which says, &lsquo;It is only through words that conflicts begin. It is only through words that people have fun. It is only through words that people gain wealth. So, words should be used sparingly.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Usually, when people have some misunderstanding, they say, &lsquo;Let us talk it out.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The talk it out does not work at all. We should never talk it out. Just move on, that&rsquo;s it! Don&rsquo;t sit and discuss the past. Don&rsquo;t ask any explanation about the past. When a mistake happens, it happened, that&rsquo;s it. You should move on.</p>

<p>Just imagine yourself in a position where you do a mistake and someone keeps asking for an explanation about your mistake. It is such a burden to explain to somebody or to justify oneself, right?</p>

<p>Never make the other person feel guilty. This is very important. Anyone whom you make to feel guilty will cease to be your friend somewhere deep inside. The bond of friendship gets loosened.</p>

<p>There is a skill in making a person aware of his mistake without making him feel guilty. However, the normal tendency in human beings is to make someone feel guilty and then feel happy about it. We have to rise above this normal tendency, and not make someone feel guilty. Then, your relationship will be longstanding.</p>

<p>There is one secret for women and one for men. Maybe this will work if you think about it. For women, you should never step on the ego of your man.</p>

<p>The whole world may say to a gentleman that he has no brains, but the wife should never say that. She should always say, &lsquo;You are the most intelligent person on the planet. Just the fact that you don&rsquo;t use your brain does not mean you don&rsquo;t have it!&rsquo;</p>

<p>She should always pump his ego. This is very much essential.</p>

<p>If the lady keeps telling her partner, &lsquo;You are good for nothing. You are a vegetable&rsquo;, he will really become one!</p>

<p>Now, the secret for men &ndash; A man should never step on the emotions of a woman. She may complain to you about her brother, or mother, or family, but you should not join the bandwagon. The moment you start nodding at her complaint, she will turn around. Instead of dwelling on her complaints, she will complain about you. She will start turning the wheel around.</p>

<p>And if she wants to go for some religious program, pilgrimage, movie or shopping, just agree and give her the credit card!</p>

<p>So, if you don&rsquo;t step on the emotion of a woman, everything will be fine.</p>

<p>Now for both of you &ndash; Don&rsquo;t ask proof of the other person&rsquo;s love for you.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t ask, &rsquo;Do you really love me?&rsquo; Never give the burden to someone to prove his or her love for you. Do you see what I am saying?</p>

<p>If you find their love for you is less, you should say, &rsquo;Why do you love me so much?&rsquo; Don&rsquo;t say, &rsquo;You don&rsquo;t love me&rsquo;, and things like that. </p>"

<p>He said, &ldquo;Then how will I spend my evenings? All my longing will be gone. Then she becomes a nag in my head. She keeps nagging me all the time, pain in the neck. I would never make that mistake.&rdquo;</p>

<p>However beautiful a woman one has married, a partner, however beautiful they are, their eyes go elsewhere, what is not with them, because the longing has disappeared. When longing disappears, love disappears. </p>

<p>When you&rsquo;re husband, wife and you spend all twenty-four hours together, morning till night, you get tired of the person. It&rsquo;s quite but natural. Love dies very soon, within six months, one year. Then, just out of courtesy, each one says, &ldquo;Oh, I love you very much.&rdquo; There is no garden happening inside. </p>

<p>A fountain is not arising. But outside, just not to hurt the other person, says, &ldquo;Oh, you are beautiful. I love you very much, dear.&rdquo; One doesn&rsquo;t want to look into that. One doesn&rsquo;t want to say it, because there is no longing. It has all disappeared.</p>

<p>In ancient Vedic times, there was a tradition. One month during the rainy season, the wives would be sent to their parent&rsquo;s home. So in that one month, every husband would write letters. </p>

<p>People like ISIS, they hate everybody and people hate them. By hating we cannot change them and they cannot change us. They also do not know this. </p>

<p>Their idea is to change everybody. We hate them because they are doing such heinous crimes. But by hating will they change? No. Not hating them but educating them.</p>

<p>The young children need to be educated before they get into this kind of mind set. That&rsquo;s why, harmony in diversity should be part of the education.</p>

<p>We need to educate the mind because all crime begins here in the upper chamber. To educate somebody you need to have compassion.</p>

            "status": "<p>There are only five sources of misery in Life</p>

<p><strong>Avidya </strong>-Ignorance is the root cause of suffering. And what is ignorance? Thinking that which is not permanent, is permanent. To think or understand that which is not changing as changing, that which is changing as not changing. That which is not joy as joy, that which is not Self as Self. I am not the body, but I think I am the body. I am not my thoughts or emotion, but I think I am my thoughts, my emotions. Ignorance is holding on to those things of the past, this and that; having an idea of who you are. People think it&rsquo;s very complimentary to know who you are, to have an idea about who you are.</p>

<p><strong> Asmita </strong>is oneness of our intellect and our Self. Have you noticed in meetings, people say a point and stick to that point? They are actually stuck with that point. Most of the people go on arguing meaninglessly, senselessly. These senseless arguments come because they are so stuck thinking that is their intellect. Intellect as themselves. Thoughts as themselves, &ldquo;my thought, my position, my, me, me&rdquo;. Inability to see the Self and the buddhi (or the intellect) and the power of the instruments of perception as separate, is asmita.</p>

<p><strong>Raga(craving)</strong> &ndash; Craving comes with a pleasant experience. You have a pleasant experience and that creates a craving in you. This craving makes you miserable. We try to control others&rsquo; mind, saying, &ldquo;You should be this way, should be that way.&rdquo; How is it possible? Someone may have loved you yesterday, but they need not today or tomorrow. Who knows? They themselves do not know.</p>

<p>You are not behaving in an enlightened way, but you expect everyone around you to be enlightened, to have unconditional love. You will get one in a million, who can be unconditional love. When you expect that from all the people around you, you become unhappy. Knowingly, unknowingly, consciously, unconsciously, this is what everybody is doing. Everybody is expecting unconditional love from people they meet, and they don&rsquo;t even know what they&rsquo;re expecting! But their expectation is something very big, they are seeking God in everybody. And they are seeking God without seeing that God could behave in any manner He wants! They are looking for a saintly God in everybody around them. How things should be make you more miserable. Do you see what I&rsquo;m saying?</p>

<p><strong>Hatred and aversion</strong> comes with an unpleasant experience. Aversion brings the same misery as happiness brings. Craving and aversion are both sources of misery.</p>

<p><strong>Abhinivesha(fear)</strong>, an unknown fear. Though intellectually you know everything, even in great scholars a little amount of abhinivesha [fear] exists. It has been seen as such. Nature has imposed all five things in everybody. How thin this can get or how thick it will remain, makes you either evolved or un-evolved.</p>

            "status": "<p>1)<strong> Friendliness: </strong>Be friendly with people who are happy. If you are not friendly with happy people, you will be jealous. This is because you think that your enemy is happy, and you cannot tolerate your enemy being happy. So, shake hands with happy people. Such an attitude does a lot of good to your mind.</p>

<p>2) <strong>Compassion: </strong>Do not be friendly with people who are miserable, instead, have compassion for them. If you are friendly with unhappy people you will become unhappy. And if you become unhappy, you can never help them to come out of their misery. </p>

<p>Many people have gotten into trouble by being friendly with unhappy people; both become miserable. It is like a doctor going to a patient who is sick, and the doctor also becomes sick. If the doctor also thinks, &lsquo;How can I alone be healthy? Let me also share the patient&rsquo;s misery&rsquo;, then who will help the patient then?</p>

<p>So, what should be the attitude with people who are miserable? Compassion, not pity.</p>

<p>3) <strong>Happiness:</strong> For people who are doing good work or who are successful in the world, you should feel happy as though you are doing it.</p>

<p>For example, someone is a good singer, singing and bringing joy to everybody, seeing him you should think, &lsquo;I feel so happy that this person is singing so well, and making everyone happy.&rsquo;</p>

<p>If someone is a good entertainer and he entertains everybody you should feel happy about it. If someone is a great architect and builds beautiful buildings you should feel happy about it. Whenever someone does a good job, share that happiness with them; we need to have this attitude.</p>

<p>4) <strong>Indifference:</strong> For people who are doing horrible things in the society, destroying themselves, we usually get angry at them. When you are angry, your mind suffers a huge loss. You lose so much energy, you lose your mood, and your enthusiasm. When energy and enthusiasm goes away from you, you become angry and are no better than the other person. You do not know what you are doing. So, what should you do in such a situation? Have a sort of indifference in your mind.</p>

<p>For example, there are thieves in the world, they are there, what can you do about them? First accept, be indifferent. However, this does not mean you do not take any action. Your mind is indifferent (unaffected), but you act on it.</p>

<p>These are the four attitudes that will help us to save our mind. This is what we need to do, save our mind at all costs.</p>"

See, every cell in your body is emitting some energy and the totality of all that energy around you is what you call the mind. Mind is not present at some point in the brain, but mind is all over the body. There is so much deep knowledge about consciousness; we should sometime go much deeper into it. We will understand more. The more you understand, the more wonder-struck you are. Wow!</p>

<p>You know, people have phantom hand, that means they really don&rsquo;t have a hand, but they feel they have a hand and they feel sensations like itching or paining in that hand. 
People who have lost their hand or leg in a war or accident, later sometimes, they feel they have a phantom hand or a leg. Though, they don&rsquo;t have it physically. That explains or gives a clue that the mind is not just in one spot, it is all around the body. The aura of body is mind. We think that mind is inside the body, it is the other way around - Body is inside the mind. Body is like the wick of the candle and mind is like the glow all around.</p>"
